Some of them pointed at me, and a couple of bullets sang past my head; so I broke away across the paddy-fields, and found myself late at night safe within the walls at Agra.\n\n“As it proved, however, there was no great safety there, either. The whole country was up like a swarm of bees. Wherever the English could collect in little bands they held just the ground that their guns commanded. Everywhere else they were helpless fugitives. It was a fight of the millions against the hundreds; and the cruellest part of it was that these men that we fought against, foot, horse, and gunners, were our own picked troops, whom we had taught and trained, handling our own weapons, and blowing our own bugle-calls. At Agra there were the 3rd Bengal Fusiliers, some Sikhs, two troops of horse, and a battery of artillery. A volunteer corps of clerks and merchants had been formed, and this I joined, wooden leg and all. We went out to meet the rebels at Shahgunge early in July, and we beat them back for a time, but our powder gave out, and we had to fall back upon the city.\n\n“Nothing but the worst news came to us from every side,—which is not to be wondered at, for if you look at the map you will see that we were right in the heart of it. Lucknow is rather better than a hundred miles to the east, and Cawnpore about as far to the south. From every point on the compass there was nothing but torture and murder and outrage.\n\n“The city of Agra is a great place, swarming with fanatics and fierce devil-worshippers of all sorts. Our handful of men were lost among the narrow, winding streets. Our leader moved across the river, therefore, and took up his position in the old fort at Agra. I don’t know if any of you gentlemen have ever read or heard anything of that old fort. It is a very queer place,—the queerest that ever I was in, and I have been in some rum corners, too. First of all, it is enormous in size. I should think that the enclosure must be acres and acres. There is a modern part, which took all our garrison, women, children, stores, and everything else, with plenty of room over. But the modern part is nothing like the size of the old quarter, where nobody goes, and which is given over to the scorpions and the centipedes. It is all full of great deserted halls, and winding passages, and long corridors twisting in and out, so that it is easy enough for folk to get lost in it. For this reason it was seldom that any one went into it, though now and again a party with torches might go exploring.\n\n“The river washes along the front of the old fort, and so protects it, but on the sides and behind there are many doors, and these had to be guarded, of course, in the old quarter as well as in that which was actually held by our troops. We were short-handed, with hardly men enough to man the angles of the building and to serve the guns. It was impossible for us, therefore, to station a strong guard at every one of the innumerable gates. What we did was to organise a central guard-house in the middle of the fort, and to leave each gate under the charge of one white man and two or three natives. I was selected to take charge during certain hours of the night of a small isolated door upon the southwest side of the building. Two Sikh troopers were placed under my command, and I was instructed if anything went wrong to fire my musket, when I might rely upon help coming at once from the central guard. As the guard was a good two hundred paces away, however, and as the space between was cut up into a labyrinth of passages and corridors, I had great doubts as to whether they could arrive in time to be of any use in case of an actual attack.\n\n“Well, I was pretty proud at having this small command given me, since I was a raw recruit, and a game-legged one at that. For two nights I kept the watch with my Punjaubees. They were tall, fierce-looking chaps, Mahomet Singh and Abdullah Khan by name, both old fighting-men who had borne arms against us at Chilian-wallah. They could talk English pretty well, but I could get little out of them. They preferred to stand together and jabber all night in their queer Sikh lingo. For myself, I used to stand outside the gateway, looking down on the broad, winding river and on the twinkling lights of the great city. The beating of drums, the rattle of tomtoms, and the yells and howls of the rebels, drunk with opium and with bang, were enough to remind us all night of our dangerous neighbours across the stream. Every two hours the officer of the night used to come round to all the posts, to make sure that all was well.\n\n“The third night of my watch was dark and dirty, with a small, driving rain. It was dreary work standing in the gateway hour after hour in such weather. I tried again and again to make my Sikhs talk, but without much success. At two in the morning the rounds passed, and broke for a moment the weariness of the night. Finding that my companions would not be led into conversation, I took out my pipe, and laid down my musket to strike the match. In an instant the two Sikhs were upon me. One of them snatched my firelock up and levelled it at my head, while the other held a great knife to my throat and swore between\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>AGRA<|>GEO<|>Agra is a city that served as a refuge during a conflict, known for its old fort and strategic importance in the region.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHAHGUNGE<|>GEO<|>Shahgunge is a location where a battle took place against rebels in July.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LUCKNOW<|>GEO<|>Lucknow is a city located about a hundred miles to the east of Agra, mentioned in the context of the conflict.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CAWNPORE<|>GEO<|>Cawnpore is a city located about a hundred miles to the south of Agra, mentioned in the context of the conflict.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>3RD BENGAL FUSILIERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The 3rd Bengal Fusiliers is a military unit that was present in Agra during the conflict.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SIKHS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Sikhs refers to a group of soldiers involved in the conflict, fighting alongside the British forces.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUNJAUBEES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Punjaubees are soldiers from Punjab, serving under the command of the narrator during the conflict.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAHOMET SINGH<|>PERSON<|>Mahomet Singh is a Sikh trooper who served under the narrator's command during the conflict.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ABDULLAH KHAN<|>PERSON<|>Abdullah Khan is another Sikh trooper who served under the narrator's command during the conflict.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AGRA<|>3RD BENGAL FUSILIERS<|>The 3rd Bengal Fusiliers were stationed in Agra during the conflict, contributing to the defense of the city<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AGRA<|>SHAHGUNGE<|>The narrator and the volunteer corps from Agra went out to meet the rebels at Shahgunge<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AGRA<|>LUCKNOW<|>Lucknow is mentioned as a nearby city, indicating the broader context of the conflict surrounding Agra<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AGRA<|>CAWNPORE<|>Cawnpore is mentioned as a nearby city, indicating the broader context of the conflict surrounding Agra<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AGRA<|>PUNJAUBEES<|>The Punjaubees were part of the defense in Agra, serving under the narrator<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAHOMET SINGH<|>PUNJAUBEES<|>Mahomet Singh was a member of the Punjaubees serving under the narrator<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ABDULLAH KHAN<|>PUNJAUBEES<|>Abdullah Khan was a member of the Punjaubees serving under the narrator<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>3RD BENGAL FUSILIERS<|>SIKHS<|>The Sikhs fought alongside the 3rd Bengal Fusiliers during the conflict<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
