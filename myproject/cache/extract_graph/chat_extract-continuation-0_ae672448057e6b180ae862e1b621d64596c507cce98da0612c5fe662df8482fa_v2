At two in the morning the rounds passed, and broke for a moment the weariness of the night. Finding that my companions would not be led into conversation, I took out my pipe, and laid down my musket to strike the match. In an instant the two Sikhs were upon me. One of them snatched my firelock up and levelled it at my head, while the other held a great knife to my throat and swore between his teeth that he would plunge it into me if I moved a step.\n\n“My first thought was that these fellows were in league with the rebels, and that this was the beginning of an assault. If our door were in the hands of the Sepoys the place must fall, and the women and children be treated as they were in Cawnpore. Maybe you gentlemen think that I am just making out a case for myself, but I give you my word that when I thought of that, though I felt the point of the knife at my throat, I opened my mouth with the intention of giving a scream, if it was my last one, which might alarm the main guard. The man who held me seemed to know my thoughts; for, even as I braced myself to it, he whispered, ‘Don’t make a noise. The fort is safe enough. There are no rebel dogs on this side of the river.’ There was the ring of truth in what he said, and I knew that if I raised my voice I was a dead man. I could read it in the fellow’s brown eyes. I waited, therefore, in silence, to see what it was that they wanted from me.\n\n“‘Listen to me, Sahib,’ said the taller and fiercer of the pair, the one whom they called Abdullah Khan. ‘You must either be with us now or you must be silenced forever. The thing is too great a one for us to hesitate. Either you are heart and soul with us on your oath on the cross of the Christians, or your body this night shall be thrown into the ditch and we shall pass over to our brothers in the rebel army. There is no middle way. Which is it to be, death or life? We can only give you three minutes to decide, for the time is passing, and all must be done before the rounds come again.’\n\n“‘How can I decide?’ said I. ‘You have not told me what you want of me. But I tell you now that if it is anything against the safety of the fort I will have no truck with it, so you can drive home your knife and welcome.’\n\n“‘It is nothing against the fort,’ said he. ‘We only ask you to do that which your countrymen come to this land for. We ask you to be rich. If you will be one of us this night, we will swear to you upon the naked knife, and by the threefold oath which no Sikh was ever known to break, that you shall have your fair share of the loot. A quarter of the treasure shall be yours. We can say no fairer.’\n\n“‘But what is the treasure, then?’ I asked. ‘I am as ready to be rich as you can be, if you will but show me how it can be done.’\n\n“‘You will swear, then,’ said he, ‘by the bones of your father, by the honour of your mother, by the cross of your faith, to raise no hand and speak no word against us, either now or afterwards?’\n\n“‘I will swear it,’ I answered, ‘provided that the fort is not endangered.’\n\n“‘Then my comrade and I will swear that you shall have a quarter of the treasure which shall be equally divided among the four of us.’\n\n“‘There are but three,’ said I.\n\n“‘No; Dost Akbar must have his share. We can tell the tale to you while we await them. Do you stand at the gate, Mahomet Singh, and give notice of their coming. The thing stands thus, Sahib, and I tell it to you because I know that an oath is binding upon a Feringhee, and that we may trust you. Had you been a lying Hindoo, though you had sworn by all the gods in their false temples, your blood would have been upon the knife, and your body in the water. But the Sikh knows the Englishman, and the Englishman knows the Sikh. Hearken, then, to what I have to say.\n\n“‘There is a rajah in the northern provinces who has much wealth, though his lands are small. Much has come to him from his father, and more still he has set by himself, for he is of a low nature and hoards his gold rather than spend it. When the troubles broke out he would be friends both with the lion and the tiger,—with the Sepoy and with the Company’s Raj. Soon, however, it seemed to him that the white men’s day was come, for through all the land he could hear of nothing but of their death and their overthrow. Yet, being a careful man, he made such plans that, come what might, half at least of his treasure should be left to him. That which was in gold and silver he kept by him in the vaults of his palace, but the most precious stones and the choicest pearls that he had he put in an iron box, and sent it by a trusty servant who, under the guise of a merchant, should take it to the fort at Agra, there to lie until the land is at peace. Thus, if the rebels won he would have his money, but if the Company conquered his jewels would be saved to him. Having thus divided his hoard, he threw himself into the cause of the Sepoys, since they\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ABDUALLAH KHAN<|>PERSON<|>Abdullah Khan is a Sikh who confronts the narrator and offers him a chance to join in a plot against the fort's safety in exchange for treasure.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAHOMET SINGH<|>PERSON<|>Mahomet Singh is a Sikh who is tasked with watching for the arrival of Dost Akbar.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DOST AKBAR<|>PERSON<|>Dost Akbar is mentioned as a comrade of Abdullah Khan and Mahomet Singh, who is expected to arrive.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RAJAH<|>PERSON<|>The Rajah is a wealthy ruler in the northern provinces who hoards treasure and has made plans to protect his wealth during the conflict.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AGRA<|>GEO<|>Agra is a fort where the Rajah's most precious jewels are sent for safekeeping.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FORT<|>GEO<|>The fort is a military stronghold that is under threat from rebels and is the central location of the narrator's concerns.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TREASURE<|>EVENT<|>The treasure refers to the wealth that Abdullah Khan and his comrades are attempting to acquire through their plot.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ABDUALLAH KHAN<|>FORT<|>Abdullah Khan threatens the narrator regarding the safety of the fort, indicating a direct relationship between his actions and the fort's security.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ABDUALLAH KHAN<|>DOST AKBAR<|>Abdullah Khan mentions Dost Akbar as a comrade who is expected to join them, indicating a partnership in their plans.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAHOMET SINGH<|>DOST AKBAR<|>Mahomet Singh is tasked with watching for Dost Akbar's arrival, indicating a direct connection in their roles within the group.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RAJAH<|>TREASURE<|>The Rajah is the owner of the treasure that is being sought by Abdullah Khan and his comrades, establishing a motive for their actions.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RAJAH<|>AGRA<|>The Rajah's treasure is sent to Agra for safekeeping, indicating a geographical and strategic relationship.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FORT<|>AGRA<|>The fort at Agra is a location of strategic importance during the conflict, linking it to the narrator's concerns about safety.<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
