I trust that he may not remember any of the answers which I gave him that night. Holmes declares that he overheard me caution him against the great danger of taking more than two drops of castor oil, while I recommended strychnine in large doses as a sedative. However that may be, I was certainly relieved when our cab pulled up with a jerk and the coachman sprang down to open the door.\n\n“This, Miss Morstan, is Pondicherry Lodge,” said Mr. Thaddeus Sholto, as he handed her out.\nChapter V\nThe Tragedy of Pondicherry Lodge\n\nIt was nearly eleven o’clock when we reached this final stage of our night’s adventures. We had left the damp fog of the great city behind us, and the night was fairly fine. A warm wind blew from the westward, and heavy clouds moved slowly across the sky, with half a moon peeping occasionally through the rifts. It was clear enough to see for some distance, but Thaddeus Sholto took down one of the side-lamps from the carriage to give us a better light upon our way.\n\nPondicherry Lodge stood in its own grounds, and was girt round with a very high stone wall topped with broken glass. A single narrow iron-clamped door formed the only means of entrance. On this our guide knocked with a peculiar postman-like rat-tat.\n\n“Who is there?” cried a gruff voice from within.\n\n“It is I, McMurdo. You surely know my knock by this time.”\n\nThere was a grumbling sound and a clanking and jarring of keys. The door swung heavily back, and a short, deep-chested man stood in the opening, with the yellow light of the lantern shining upon his protruded face and twinkling distrustful eyes.\n\n“That you, Mr. Thaddeus? But who are the others? I had no orders about them from the master.”\n\n“No, McMurdo? You surprise me! I told my brother last night that I should bring some friends.”\n\n“He ain’t been out o’ his room to-day, Mr. Thaddeus, and I have no orders. You know very well that I must stick to regulations. I can let you in, but your friends must just stop where they are.”\n\nThis was an unexpected obstacle. Thaddeus Sholto looked about him in a perplexed and helpless manner. “This is too bad of you, McMurdo!” he said. “If I guarantee them, that is enough for you. There is the young lady, too. She cannot wait on the public road at this hour.”\n\n“Very sorry, Mr. Thaddeus,” said the porter, inexorably. “Folk may be friends o’ yours, and yet no friends o’ the master’s. He pays me well to do my duty, and my duty I’ll do. I don’t know none o’ your friends.”\n\n“Oh, yes you do, McMurdo,” cried Sherlock Holmes, genially. “I don’t think you can have forgotten me. Don’t you remember the amateur who fought three rounds with you at Alison’s rooms on the night of your benefit four years back?”\n\n“Not Mr. Sherlock Holmes!” roared the prize-fighter. “God’s truth! how could I have mistook you? If instead o’ standin’ there so quiet you had just stepped up and given me that cross-hit of yours under the jaw, I’d ha’ known you without a question. Ah, you’re one that has wasted your gifts, you have! You might have aimed high, if you had joined the fancy.”\n\n“You see, Watson, if all else fails me I have still one of the scientific professions open to me,” said Holmes, laughing. “Our friend won’t keep us out in the cold now, I am sure.”\n\n“In you come, sir, in you come,—you and your friends,” he answered. “Very sorry, Mr. Thaddeus, but orders are very strict. Had to be certain of your friends before I let them in.”\n\nInside, a gravel path wound through desolate grounds to a huge clump of a house, square and prosaic, all plunged in shadow save where a moonbeam struck one corner and glimmered in a garret window. The vast size of the building, with its gloom and its deathly silence, struck a chill to the heart. Even Thaddeus Sholto seemed ill at ease, and the lantern quivered and rattled in his hand.\n\n“I cannot understand it,” he said. “There must be some mistake. I distinctly told Bartholomew that we should be here, and yet there is no light in his window. I do not know what to make of it.”\n\n“Does he always guard the premises in this way?” asked Holmes.\n\n“Yes; he has followed my father’s custom. He was the favourite son, you know, and I sometimes think that my father may have told him more than he ever told me. That is Bartholomew’s window up there where the moonshine strikes. It is quite bright, but there is no light from within, I think.”\n\n“None,” said Holmes. “But I see the glint of a light in that little window beside the door.”\n\n“Ah, that is the housekeeper’s room. That is where old Mrs. Bernstone sits. She can tell us all about it. But perhaps you would not mind waiting here for a minute or two, for if we all go in together and she has no word of our coming she may be alarmed. But hush! what is that?”\n\nHe held\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PONDICHERRY LODGE<|>GEO<|>Pondicherry Lodge is a large, gloomy house surrounded by a high stone wall, where significant events take place in the narrative.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THADDEUS SHOLTO<|>PERSON<|>Thaddeus Sholto is a character who guides others to Pondicherry Lodge and is concerned about the absence of his brother.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHERLOCK HOLMES<|>PERSON<|>Sherlock Holmes is a famous detective who is accompanying Thaddeus Sholto and is recognized by the porter McMurdo.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MCMURDO<|>PERSON<|>McMurdo is the porter at Pondicherry Lodge who is strict about the entrance regulations and recognizes Sherlock Holmes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BARTHOLOMEW<|>PERSON<|>Bartholomew is Thaddeus Sholto's brother, who is expected to be at Pondicherry Lodge but is not present when they arrive.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MRS.
