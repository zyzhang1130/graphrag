Miss Morstan has done me the honour to accept me as a husband in prospective.”\n\nHe gave a most dismal groan. “I feared as much,” said he. “I really cannot congratulate you.”\n\nI was a little hurt. “Have you any reason to be dissatisfied with my choice?” I asked.\n\n“Not at all. I think she is one of the most charming young ladies I ever met, and might have been most useful in such work as we have been doing. She had a decided genius that way: witness the way in which she preserved that Agra plan from all the other papers of her father. But love is an emotional thing, and whatever is emotional is opposed to that true cold reason which I place above all things. I should never marry myself, lest I bias my judgment.”\n\n“I trust,” said I, laughing, “that my judgment may survive the ordeal. But you look weary.”\n\n“Yes, the reaction is already upon me. I shall be as limp as a rag for a week.”\n\n“Strange,” said I, “how terms of what in another man I should call laziness alternate with your fits of splendid energy and vigour.”\n\n“Yes,” he answered, “there are in me the makings of a very fine loafer and also of a pretty spry sort of fellow. I often think of those lines of old Goethe,—\n\nSchade dass die Natur nur einen Mensch aus Dir schuf,\nDenn zum würdigen Mann war und zum Schelmen der Stoff.\n\n“By the way, à propos of this Norwood business, you see that they had, as I surmised, a confederate in the house, who could be none other than Lal Rao, the butler: so Jones actually has the undivided honour of having caught one fish in his great haul.”\n\n“The division seems rather unfair,” I remarked. “You have done all the work in this business. I get a wife out of it, Jones gets the credit, pray what remains for you?”\n\n“For me,” said Sherlock Holmes, “there still remains the cocaine-bottle.” And he stretched his long white hand up for it.\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE SIGN OF THE FOUR ***\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will be renamed.\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without permission and without paying copyright royalties.
