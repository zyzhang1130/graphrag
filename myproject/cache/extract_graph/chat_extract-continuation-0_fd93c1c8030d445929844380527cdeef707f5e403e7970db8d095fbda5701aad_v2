I was given a hut in Hope Town, which is a small place on the slopes of Mount Harriet, and I was left pretty much to myself. It is a dreary, fever-stricken place, and all beyond our little clearings was infested with wild cannibal natives, who were ready enough to blow a poisoned dart at us if they saw a chance. There was digging, and ditching, and yam-planting, and a dozen other things to be done, so we were busy enough all day; though in the evening we had a little time to ourselves. Among other things, I learned to dispense drugs for the surgeon, and picked up a smattering of his knowledge. All the time I was on the lookout for a chance of escape; but it is hundreds of miles from any other land, and there is little or no wind in those seas: so it was a terribly difficult job to get away.\n\nâ€œThe surgeon, Dr. Somerton, was a fast, sporting young chap, and the other young officers would meet in his rooms of an evening and play cards. The surgery, where I used to make up my drugs, was next to his sitting-room, with a small window between us. Often, if I felt lonesome, I used to turn out the lamp in the surgery, and then, standing there, I could hear their talk and watch their play. I am fond of a hand at cards myself, and it was almost as good as having one to watch the others. There was Major Sholto, Captain Morstan, and Lieutenant Bromley Brown, who were in command of the native troops, and there was the surgeon himself, and two or three prison-officials, crafty old hands who played a nice sly safe game. A very snug little party they used to make.\n\nâ€œWell, there was one thing which very soon struck me, and that was that the soldiers used always to lose and the civilians to win. Mind, I donâ€™t say that there was anything unfair, but so it was. These prison-chaps had done little else than play cards ever since they had been at the Andamans, and they knew each otherâ€™s game to a point, while the others just played to pass the time and threw their cards down anyhow. Night after night the soldiers got up poorer men, and the poorer they got the more keen they were to play. Major Sholto was the hardest hit. He used to pay in notes and gold at first, but soon it came to notes of hand and for big sums. He sometimes would win for a few deals, just to give him heart, and then the luck would set in against him worse than ever. All day he would wander about as black as thunder, and he took to drinking a deal more than was good for him.\n\nâ€œOne night he lost even more heavily than usual. I was sitting in my hut when he and Captain Morstan came stumbling along on the way to their quarters. They were bosom friends, those two, and never far apart. The major was raving about his losses.\n\nâ€œâ€˜Itâ€™s all up, Morstan,â€™ he was saying, as they passed my hut. â€˜I shall have to send in my papers. I am a ruined man.â€™\n\nâ€œâ€˜Nonsense, old chap!â€™ said the other, slapping him upon the shoulder. â€˜Iâ€™ve had a nasty facer myself, butâ€”â€™ That was all I could hear, but it was enough to set me thinking.\n\nâ€œA couple of days later Major Sholto was strolling on the beach: so I took the chance of speaking to him.\n\nâ€œâ€˜I wish to have your advice, major,â€™ said I.\n\nâ€œâ€˜Well, Small, what is it?â€™ he asked, taking his cheroot from his lips.\n\nâ€œâ€˜I wanted to ask you, sir,â€™ said I, â€˜who is the proper person to whom hidden treasure should be handed over. I know where half a million worth lies, and, as I cannot use it myself, I thought perhaps the best thing that I could do would be to hand it over to the proper authorities, and then perhaps they would get my sentence shortened for me.â€™\n\nâ€œâ€˜Half a million, Small?â€™ he gasped, looking hard at me to see if I was in earnest.\n\nâ€œâ€˜Quite that, sir,â€”in jewels and pearls. It lies there ready for any one. And the queer thing about it is that the real owner is outlawed and cannot hold property, so that it belongs to the first comer.â€™\n\nâ€œâ€˜To government, Small,â€™ he stammered,â€”â€˜to government.â€™ But he said it in a halting fashion, and I knew in my heart that I had got him.\n\nâ€œâ€˜You think, then, sir, that I should give the information to the Governor-General?â€™ said I, quietly.\n\nâ€œâ€˜Well, well, you must not do anything rash, or that you might repent. Let me hear all about it, Small. Give me the facts.â€™\n\nâ€œI told him the whole story, with small changes so that he could not identify the places. When I had finished he stood stock still and full of thought. I could see by the twitch of his lip that there was a struggle going on within him.\n\nâ€œâ€˜This is a very important matter, Small,â€™ he said, at last. â€˜You must not say a word to any one about it, and I shall see you again soon.â€™\n\nâ€œTwo nights later he and his friend Captain Morstan came to my hut in the dead of the night with a lantern.\n\nâ€œâ€˜I want you just to let Captain Morstan hear that story from your own lips, Small,â€™ said he.\n\nâ€œI repeated it as I had told it before.\n\nâ€œâ€˜It rings true, eh?â€™ said he. â€˜Itâ€™s good enough to act upon?â€™\n\nâ€œCaptain Morstan nodded\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HOPE TOWN<|>GEO<|>Hope Town is a small place located on the slopes of Mount Harriet, where the narrator was given a hut to stay in.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MOUNT HARRIET<|>GEO<|>Mount Harriet is a geographical location near Hope Town, known for its dreary and fever-stricken environment.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DR.
