An oasis of art in the howling desert of South London.‚Äù\n\nWe were all astonished by the appearance of the apartment into which he invited us. In that sorry house it looked as out of place as a diamond of the first water in a setting of brass. The richest and glossiest of curtains and tapestries draped the walls, looped back here and there to expose some richly-mounted painting or Oriental vase. The carpet was of amber-and-black, so soft and so thick that the foot sank pleasantly into it, as into a bed of moss. Two great tiger-skins thrown athwart it increased the suggestion of Eastern luxury, as did a huge hookah which stood upon a mat in the corner. A lamp in the fashion of a silver dove was hung from an almost invisible golden wire in the centre of the room. As it burned it filled the air with a subtle and aromatic odour.\n\n‚ÄúMr. Thaddeus Sholto,‚Äù said the little man, still jerking and smiling. ‚ÄúThat is my name. You are Miss Morstan, of course. And these gentlemen‚Äî‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThis is Mr. Sherlock Holmes, and this is Dr. Watson.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúA doctor, eh?‚Äù cried he, much excited. ‚ÄúHave you your stethoscope? Might I ask you‚Äîwould you have the kindness? I have grave doubts as to my mitral valve, if you would be so very good. The aortic I may rely upon, but I should value your opinion upon the mitral.‚Äù\n\nI listened to his heart, as requested, but was unable to find anything amiss, save indeed that he was in an ecstasy of fear, for he shivered from head to foot. ‚ÄúIt appears to be normal,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúYou have no cause for uneasiness.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou will excuse my anxiety, Miss Morstan,‚Äù he remarked, airily. ‚ÄúI am a great sufferer, and I have long had suspicions as to that valve. I am delighted to hear that they are unwarranted. Had your father, Miss Morstan, refrained from throwing a strain upon his heart, he might have been alive now.‚Äù\n\nI could have struck the man across the face, so hot was I at this callous and off-hand reference to so delicate a matter. Miss Morstan sat down, and her face grew white to the lips. ‚ÄúI knew in my heart that he was dead,‚Äù said she.\n\n‚ÄúI can give you every information,‚Äù said he, ‚Äúand, what is more, I can do you justice; and I will, too, whatever Brother Bartholomew may say. I am so glad to have your friends here, not only as an escort to you, but also as witnesses to what I am about to do and say. The three of us can show a bold front to Brother Bartholomew. But let us have no outsiders,‚Äîno police or officials. We can settle everything satisfactorily among ourselves, without any interference. Nothing would annoy Brother Bartholomew more than any publicity.‚Äù He sat down upon a low settee and blinked at us inquiringly with his weak, watery blue eyes.\n\n‚ÄúFor my part,‚Äù said Holmes, ‚Äúwhatever you may choose to say will go no further.‚Äù\n\nI nodded to show my agreement.\n\n‚ÄúThat is well! That is well!‚Äù said he. ‚ÄúMay I offer you a glass of Chianti, Miss Morstan? Or of Tokay? I keep no other wines. Shall I open a flask? No? Well, then, I trust that you have no objection to tobacco-smoke, to the mild balsamic odour of the Eastern tobacco. I am a little nervous, and I find my hookah an invaluable sedative.‚Äù He applied a taper to the great bowl, and the smoke bubbled merrily through the rose-water. We sat all three in a semi-circle, with our heads advanced, and our chins upon our hands, while the strange, jerky little fellow, with his high, shining head, puffed uneasily in the centre.\n\n‚ÄúWhen I first determined to make this communication to you,‚Äù said he, ‚ÄúI might have given you my address, but I feared that you might disregard my request and bring unpleasant people with you. I took the liberty, therefore, of making an appointment in such a way that my man Williams might be able to see you first. I have complete confidence in his discretion, and he had orders, if he were dissatisfied, to proceed no further in the matter. You will excuse these precautions, but I am a man of somewhat retiring, and I might even say refined, tastes, and there is nothing more un√¶sthetic than a policeman. I have a natural shrinking from all forms of rough materialism. I seldom come in contact with the rough crowd. I live, as you see, with some little atmosphere of elegance around me. I may call myself a patron of the arts. It is my weakness. The landscape is a genuine Corot, and, though a connoisseur might perhaps throw a doubt upon that Salvator Rosa, there cannot be the least question about the Bouguereau. I am partial to the modern French school.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou will excuse me, Mr. Sholto,‚Äù said Miss Morstan, ‚Äúbut I am here at your request to learn something which you desire to tell me. It is very late, and I should desire the interview to be as short as possible.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúAt the best it must take some time,‚Äù he answered; ‚Äúfor we shall certainly have to go to Norwood and see Brother Bartholomew. We shall all go and try if we can get the better of Brother Bartholomew. He is very angry with me for taking the course which has seemed right to me. I had quite high words with him last night\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
