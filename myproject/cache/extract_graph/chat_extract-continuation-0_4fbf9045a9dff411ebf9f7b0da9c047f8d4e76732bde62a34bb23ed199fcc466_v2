I left him here last night, and I heard him lock the door as I came downstairs.”\n\n“What time was that?”\n\n“It was ten o’clock. And now he is dead, and the police will be called in, and I shall be suspected of having had a hand in it. Oh, yes, I am sure I shall. But you don’t think so, gentlemen? Surely you don’t think that it was I? Is it likely that I would have brought you here if it were I? Oh, dear! oh, dear! I know that I shall go mad!” He jerked his arms and stamped his feet in a kind of convulsive frenzy.\n\n“You have no reason for fear, Mr. Sholto,” said Holmes, kindly, putting his hand upon his shoulder. “Take my advice, and drive down to the station to report this matter to the police. Offer to assist them in every way. We shall wait here until your return.”\n\nThe little man obeyed in a half-stupefied fashion, and we heard him stumbling down the stairs in the dark.\nChapter VI\nSherlock Holmes Gives a Demonstration\n\n“Now, Watson,” said Holmes, rubbing his hands, “we have half an hour to ourselves. Let us make good use of it. My case is, as I have told you, almost complete; but we must not err on the side of over-confidence. Simple as the case seems now, there may be something deeper underlying it.”\n\n“Simple!” I ejaculated.\n\n“Surely,” said he, with something of the air of a clinical professor expounding to his class. “Just sit in the corner there, that your footprints may not complicate matters. Now to work! In the first place, how did these folk come, and how did they go? The door has not been opened since last night. How of the window?” He carried the lamp across to it, muttering his observations aloud the while, but addressing them to himself rather than to me. “Window is snibbed on the inner side. Framework is solid. No hinges at the side. Let us open it. No water-pipe near. Roof quite out of reach. Yet a man has mounted by the window. It rained a little last night. Here is the print of a foot in mould upon the sill. And here is a circular muddy mark, and here again upon the floor, and here again by the table. See here, Watson! This is really a very pretty demonstration.”\n\nI looked at the round, well-defined muddy discs. “This is not a footmark,” said I.\n\n“It is something much more valuable to us. It is the impression of a wooden stump. You see here on the sill is the boot-mark, a heavy boot with the broad metal heel, and beside it is the mark of the timber-toe.”\n\n“It is the wooden-legged man.”\n\n“Quite so. But there has been some one else,—a very able and efficient ally. Could you scale that wall, doctor?”\n\nI looked out of the open window. The moon still shone brightly on that angle of the house. We were a good sixty feet from the ground, and, look where I would, I could see no foothold, nor as much as a crevice in the brick-work.\n\n“It is absolutely impossible,” I answered.\n\n“Without aid it is so. But suppose you had a friend up here who lowered you this good stout rope which I see in the corner, securing one end of it to this great hook in the wall. Then, I think, if you were an active man, You might swarm up, wooden leg and all. You would depart, of course, in the same fashion, and your ally would draw up the rope, untie it from the hook, shut the window, snib it on the inside, and get away in the way that he originally came. As a minor point it may be noted,” he continued, fingering the rope, “that our wooden-legged friend, though a fair climber, was not a professional sailor. His hands were far from horny. My lens discloses more than one blood-mark, especially towards the end of the rope, from which I gather that he slipped down with such velocity that he took the skin off his hand.”\n\n“This is all very well,” said I, “but the thing becomes more unintelligible than ever. How about this mysterious ally? How came he into the room?”\n\n“Yes, the ally!” repeated Holmes, pensively. “There are features of interest about this ally. He lifts the case from the regions of the commonplace. I fancy that this ally breaks fresh ground in the annals of crime in this country,—though parallel cases suggest themselves from India, and, if my memory serves me, from Senegambia.”\n\n“How came he, then?” I reiterated. “The door is locked, the window is inaccessible. Was it through the chimney?”\n\n“The grate is much too small,” he answered. “I had already considered that possibility.”\n\n“How then?” I persisted.\n\n“You will not apply my precept,” he said, shaking his head. “How often have I said to you that when you have eliminated the impossible whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth? We know that he did not come through the door, the window, or the chimney. We also know that he could not have been concealed in the room, as there is no concealment possible. Whence, then, did he come?”\n\n“He came through the hole in the roof,” I cried.\n\n“Of course he did. He must have done so. If you will have the kindness to hold the lamp for me, we shall now extend our researches to the room above,—the secret room in which the treasure was found.”\n\nHe mounted the steps, and, seizing a rafter with\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SHERLOCK HOLMES<|>PERSON<|>Sherlock Holmes is a fictional detective known for his keen observation and logical reasoning skills, often solving complex cases that baffle the police.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WATSON<|>PERSON<|>Watson is Sherlock Holmes's friend and chronicler, who assists him in his investigations and provides a narrative perspective on their adventures.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WOODEN-LEGGED MAN<|>PERSON<|>The wooden-legged man is a mysterious character involved in the case, known for his distinctive wooden leg which leaves unique footprints.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SECRET ROOM<|>GEO<|>The secret room is a hidden space above the current room being investigated, where a treasure was found, indicating its significance in the case.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>POLICE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The police are the law enforcement agency that investigates crimes and maintains public order, called in to investigate the death mentioned in the text.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SHERLOCK HOLMES<|>WATSON<|>Sherlock Holmes and Watson work together on investigations, with Watson often assisting Holmes and documenting their cases<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SHERLOCK HOLMES<|>WOODEN-LEGGED MAN<|>Sherlock Holmes is investigating the case involving the wooden-legged man, who is a key suspect in the mystery<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WOODEN-LEGGED MAN<|>SECRET ROOM<|>The wooden-legged man is connected to the secret room, as it is suspected he may have used it to hide or escape<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SHERLOCK HOLMES<|>POLICE<|>Sherlock Holmes often collaborates with the police to solve cases, providing insights that aid their investigations<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WATSON<|>SHERLOCK HOLMES<|>Watson supports Holmes in his investigations, often providing moral support and practical assistance<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
