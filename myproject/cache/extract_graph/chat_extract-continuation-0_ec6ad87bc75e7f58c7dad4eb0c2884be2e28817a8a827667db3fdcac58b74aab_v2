When we had feasted our eyes we took them all out and made a list of them. There were one hundred and forty-three diamonds of the first water, including one which has been called, I believe, ‘the Great Mogul’ and is said to be the second largest stone in existence. Then there were ninety-seven very fine emeralds, and one hundred and seventy rubies, some of which, however, were small. There were forty carbuncles, two hundred and ten sapphires, sixty-one agates, and a great quantity of beryls, onyxes, cats’-eyes, turquoises, and other stones, the very names of which I did not know at the time, though I have become more familiar with them since. Besides this, there were nearly three hundred very fine pearls, twelve of which were set in a gold coronet. By the way, these last had been taken out of the chest and were not there when I recovered it.\n\n“After we had counted our treasures we put them back into the chest and carried them to the gateway to show them to Mahomet Singh. Then we solemnly renewed our oath to stand by each other and be true to our secret. We agreed to conceal our loot in a safe place until the country should be at peace again, and then to divide it equally among ourselves. There was no use dividing it at present, for if gems of such value were found upon us it would cause suspicion, and there was no privacy in the fort nor any place where we could keep them. We carried the box, therefore, into the same hall where we had buried the body, and there, under certain bricks in the best-preserved wall, we made a hollow and put our treasure. We made careful note of the place, and next day I drew four plans, one for each of us, and put the sign of the four of us at the bottom, for we had sworn that we should each always act for all, so that none might take advantage. That is an oath that I can put my hand to my heart and swear that I have never broken.\n\n“Well, there’s no use my telling you gentlemen what came of the Indian mutiny. After Wilson took Delhi and Sir Colin relieved Lucknow the back of the business was broken. Fresh troops came pouring in, and Nana Sahib made himself scarce over the frontier. A flying column under Colonel Greathed came round to Agra and cleared the Pandies away from it. Peace seemed to be settling upon the country, and we four were beginning to hope that the time was at hand when we might safely go off with our shares of the plunder. In a moment, however, our hopes were shattered by our being arrested as the murderers of Achmet.\n\n“It came about in this way. When the rajah put his jewels into the hands of Achmet he did it because he knew that he was a trusty man. They are suspicious folk in the East, however: so what does this rajah do but take a second even more trusty servant and set him to play the spy upon the first? This second man was ordered never to let Achmet out of his sight, and he followed him like his shadow. He went after him that night and saw him pass through the doorway. Of course he thought he had taken refuge in the fort, and applied for admission there himself next day, but could find no trace of Achmet. This seemed to him so strange that he spoke about it to a sergeant of guides, who brought it to the ears of the commandant. A thorough search was quickly made, and the body was discovered. Thus at the very moment that we thought that all was safe we were all four seized and brought to trial on a charge of murder,—three of us because we had held the gate that night, and the fourth because he was known to have been in the company of the murdered man. Not a word about the jewels came out at the trial, for the rajah had been deposed and driven out of India: so no one had any particular interest in them. The murder, however, was clearly made out, and it was certain that we must all have been concerned in it. The three Sikhs got penal servitude for life, and I was condemned to death, though my sentence was afterwards commuted into the same as the others.\n\n“It was rather a queer position that we found ourselves in then. There we were all four tied by the leg and with precious little chance of ever getting out again, while we each held a secret which might have put each of us in a palace if we could only have made use of it. It was enough to make a man eat his heart out to have to stand the kick and the cuff of every petty jack-in-office, to have rice to eat and water to drink, when that gorgeous fortune was ready for him outside, just waiting to be picked up. It might have driven me mad; but I was always a pretty stubborn one, so I just held on and bided my time.\n\n“At last it seemed to me to have come. I was changed from Agra to Madras, and from there to Blair Island in the Andamans. There are very few white convicts at this settlement, and, as I had behaved well from the first, I soon found myself a sort of privileged person. I was given a hut in Hope Town, which is a small place on the slopes of Mount Harriet, and I was left pretty much to myself. It is a dreary, fever-stricken place, and all beyond our little clearings was infested with wild cannibal natives, who were ready enough to blow a poisoned dart at us if they saw a chance. There was digging, and ditching, and yam-planting, and a dozen other things to be done\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MAHOMET SINGH<|>PERSON<|>Mahomet Singh is a character involved in the narrative, associated with the treasure and the oath taken by the group.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ACHMET<|>PERSON<|>Achmet was a trusty servant of the rajah who was murdered, leading to the arrest of the four main characters.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RAJAH<|>PERSON<|>The rajah is a ruler who entrusted his jewels to Achmet and was later deposed and driven out of India.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AGRA<|>GEO<|>Agra is a city in India where significant events in the narrative take place, including the arrest of the main characters.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MADRAS<|>GEO<|>Madras is a city in India where the narrator was transferred after being imprisoned in Agra.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BLAIR ISLAND<|>GEO<|>Blair Island is a settlement in the Andamans where the narrator was sent as a convict.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MOUNT HARRIET<|>GEO<|>Mount Harriet is a location on Blair Island where the narrator was given a hut.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INDIAN MUTINY<|>EVENT<|>The Indian Mutiny was a significant uprising against British rule in India, which is referenced in the narrative.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAHOMET SINGH<|>ACHMET<|>Mahomet Singh is connected to Achmet through the events surrounding the treasure and the oath taken by the group<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ACHMET<|>RAJAH<|>Achmet was a servant of the rajah, entrusted with his jewels, which led to the events of the murder<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AGRA<|>MADRAS<|>The narrator was transferred from Agra to Madras as part of their imprisonment<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MADRAS<|>BLAIR ISLAND<|>The narrator was moved from Madras to Blair Island as part of their sentence<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BLAIR ISLAND<|>MOUNT HARRIET<|>Mount Harriet is a location on Blair Island where the narrator was given a hut<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INDIAN MUTINY<|>AGRA<|>The Indian Mutiny is referenced in relation to events that took place in Agra, affecting the characters<|>3)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
