I’d have come through and taken my chance with the three of them, only even as I looked at him his jaw dropped, and I knew that he was gone. I got into his room that same night, though, and I searched his papers to see if there was any record of where he had hidden our jewels. There was not a line, however: so I came away, bitter and savage as a man could be. Before I left I bethought me that if I ever met my Sikh friends again it would be a satisfaction to know that I had left some mark of our hatred; so I scrawled down the sign of the four of us, as it had been on the chart, and I pinned it on his bosom. It was too much that he should be taken to the grave without some token from the men whom he had robbed and befooled.\n\n“We earned a living at this time by my exhibiting poor Tonga at fairs and other such places as the black cannibal. He would eat raw meat and dance his war-dance: so we always had a hatful of pennies after a day’s work. I still heard all the news from Pondicherry Lodge, and for some years there was no news to hear, except that they were hunting for the treasure. At last, however, came what we had waited for so long. The treasure had been found. It was up at the top of the house, in Mr. Bartholomew Sholto’s chemical laboratory. I came at once and had a look at the place, but I could not see how with my wooden leg I was to make my way up to it. I learned, however, about a trap-door in the roof, and also about Mr. Sholto’s supper-hour. It seemed to me that I could manage the thing easily through Tonga. I brought him out with me with a long rope wound round his waist. He could climb like a cat, and he soon made his way through the roof, but, as ill luck would have it, Bartholomew Sholto was still in the room, to his cost. Tonga thought he had done something very clever in killing him, for when I came up by the rope I found him strutting about as proud as a peacock. Very much surprised was he when I made at him with the rope’s end and cursed him for a little blood-thirsty imp. I took the treasure-box and let it down, and then slid down myself, having first left the sign of the four upon the table, to show that the jewels had come back at last to those who had most right to them. Tonga then pulled up the rope, closed the window, and made off the way that he had come.\n\n“I don’t know that I have anything else to tell you. I had heard a waterman speak of the speed of Smith’s launch the Aurora, so I thought she would be a handy craft for our escape. I engaged with old Smith, and was to give him a big sum if he got us safe to our ship. He knew, no doubt, that there was some screw loose, but he was not in our secrets. All this is the truth, and if I tell it to you, gentlemen, it is not to amuse you,—for you have not done me a very good turn,—but it is because I believe the best defence I can make is just to hold back nothing, but let all the world know how badly I have myself been served by Major Sholto, and how innocent I am of the death of his son.”\n\n“A very remarkable account,” said Sherlock Holmes. “A fitting wind-up to an extremely interesting case. There is nothing at all new to me in the latter part of your narrative, except that you brought your own rope. That I did not know. By the way, I had hoped that Tonga had lost all his darts; yet he managed to shoot one at us in the boat.”\n\n“He had lost them all, sir, except the one which was in his blow-pipe at the time.”\n\n“Ah, of course,” said Holmes. “I had not thought of that.”\n\n“Is there any other point which you would like to ask about?” asked the convict, affably.\n\n“I think not, thank you,” my companion answered.\n\n“Well, Holmes,” said Athelney Jones, “You are a man to be humoured, and we all know that you are a connoisseur of crime, but duty is duty, and I have gone rather far in doing what you and your friend asked me. I shall feel more at ease when we have our story-teller here safe under lock and key. The cab still waits, and there are two inspectors downstairs. I am much obliged to you both for your assistance. Of course you will be wanted at the trial. Good-night to you.”\n\n“Good-night, gentlemen both,” said Jonathan Small.\n\n“You first, Small,” remarked the wary Jones as they left the room. “I’ll take particular care that you don’t club me with your wooden leg, whatever you may have done to the gentleman at the Andaman Isles.”\n\n“Well, and there is the end of our little drama,” I remarked, after we had set some time smoking in silence. “I fear that it may be the last investigation in which I shall have the chance of studying your methods. Miss Morstan has done me the honour to accept me as a husband in prospective.”\n\nHe gave a most dismal groan. “I feared as much,” said he. “I really cannot congratulate you.”\n\nI was a little hurt. “Have you any reason to be dissatisfied with my choice?” I asked.\n\n“Not at all. I think she is one of the most charming young ladies I ever met, and might have been most\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>JONATHAN SMALL<|>PERSON<|>Jonathan Small is a convict involved in the narrative, who recounts his story and is present at the trial discussion.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHERLOCK HOLMES<|>PERSON<|>Sherlock Holmes is a famous detective known for his investigative skills and is present during the recounting of the events.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ATHELNEY JONES<|>PERSON<|>Athelney Jones is an inspector involved in the case, who expresses his duty to ensure the convict is secured.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAJOR SHOLTO<|>PERSON<|>Major Sholto is mentioned as a character related to the events surrounding Jonathan Small and the death of his son.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TONGA<|>PERSON<|>Tonga is a character who assists Jonathan Small and is noted for his skills and actions during the treasure retrieval.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AURORA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Aurora is the name of Smith's launch, which is intended for the escape of Jonathan Small and Tonga.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PONDICHERRY LODGE<|>GEO<|>Pondicherry Lodge is a location where news was received regarding the treasure hunt.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANDAMAN ISLES<|>GEO<|>The Andaman Isles are mentioned in relation to Jonathan Small's past actions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TREASURE<|>EVENT<|>The treasure refers to the jewels that Jonathan Small and his associates were seeking and eventually retrieved.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JONATHAN SMALL<|>ATHELNEY JONES<|>Athelney Jones is responsible for ensuring Jonathan Small is secured after recounting his story<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JONATHAN SMALL<|>SHERLOCK HOLMES<|>Jonathan Small recounts his story to Sherlock Holmes, who is investigating the case<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ATHELNEY JONES<|>SHERLOCK HOLMES<|>Athelney Jones collaborates with Sherlock Holmes in the investigation and trial<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JONATHAN SMALL<|>TONGA<|>Tonga assists Jonathan Small in retrieving the treasure and is involved in the escape plan<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAJOR SHOLTO<|>JONATHAN SMALL<|>Jonathan Small is indirectly related to Major Sholto through the events leading to the death of Sholto's son<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AURORA<|>JONATHAN SMALL<|>The Aurora is the means of escape planned by Jonathan Small<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PONDICHERRY LODGE<|>JONATHAN SMALL<|>Jonathan Small receives news from Pondicherry Lodge regarding the treasure hunt<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ANDAMAN ISLES<|>JONATHAN SMALL<|>Jonathan Small references his past actions related to the Andaman Isles<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TREASURE<|>JONATHAN SMALL<|>The treasure is the central focus of Jonathan Small's narrative and actions<|>10)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
