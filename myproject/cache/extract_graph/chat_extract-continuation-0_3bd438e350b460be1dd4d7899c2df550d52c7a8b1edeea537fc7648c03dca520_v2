That is much more likely, for he would have known what their term of imprisonment was. It would not have been a surprise to him. What does he do then? He guards himself against a wooden-legged man,—a white man, mark you, for he mistakes a white tradesman for him, and actually fires a pistol at him. Now, only one white man’s name is on the chart. The others are Hindoos or Mohammedans. There is no other white man. Therefore we may say with confidence that the wooden-legged man is identical with Jonathan Small. Does the reasoning strike you as being faulty?”\n\n“No: it is clear and concise.”\n\n“Well, now, let us put ourselves in the place of Jonathan Small. Let us look at it from his point of view. He comes to England with the double idea of regaining what he would consider to be his rights and of having his revenge upon the man who had wronged him. He found out where Sholto lived, and very possibly he established communications with some one inside the house. There is this butler, Lal Rao, whom we have not seen. Mrs. Bernstone gives him far from a good character. Small could not find out, however, where the treasure was hid, for no one ever knew, save the major and one faithful servant who had died. Suddenly Small learns that the major is on his death-bed. In a frenzy lest the secret of the treasure die with him, he runs the gauntlet of the guards, makes his way to the dying man’s window, and is only deterred from entering by the presence of his two sons. Mad with hate, however, against the dead man, he enters the room that night, searches his private papers in the hope of discovering some memorandum relating to the treasure, and finally leaves a momento of his visit in the short inscription upon the card. He had doubtless planned beforehand that should he slay the major he would leave some such record upon the body as a sign that it was not a common murder, but, from the point of view of the four associates, something in the nature of an act of justice. Whimsical and bizarre conceits of this kind are common enough in the annals of crime, and usually afford valuable indications as to the criminal. Do you follow all this?”\n\n“Very clearly.”\n\n“Now, what could Jonathan Small do? He could only continue to keep a secret watch upon the efforts made to find the treasure. Possibly he leaves England and only comes back at intervals. Then comes the discovery of the garret, and he is instantly informed of it. We again trace the presence of some confederate in the household. Jonathan, with his wooden leg, is utterly unable to reach the lofty room of Bartholomew Sholto. He takes with him, however, a rather curious associate, who gets over this difficulty, but dips his naked foot into creasote, whence comes Toby, and a six-mile limp for a half-pay officer with a damaged tendo Achillis.”\n\n“But it was the associate, and not Jonathan, who committed the crime.”\n\n“Quite so. And rather to Jonathan’s disgust, to judge by the way he stamped about when he got into the room. He bore no grudge against Bartholomew Sholto, and would have preferred if he could have been simply bound and gagged. He did not wish to put his head in a halter. There was no help for it, however: the savage instincts of his companion had broken out, and the poison had done its work: so Jonathan Small left his record, lowered the treasure-box to the ground, and followed it himself. That was the train of events as far as I can decipher them. Of course as to his personal appearance he must be middle-aged, and must be sunburned after serving his time in such an oven as the Andamans. His height is readily calculated from the length of his stride, and we know that he was bearded. His hairiness was the one point which impressed itself upon Thaddeus Sholto when he saw him at the window. I don’t know that there is anything else.”\n\n“The associate?”\n\n“Ah, well, there is no great mystery in that. But you will know all about it soon enough. How sweet the morning air is! See how that one little cloud floats like a pink feather from some gigantic flamingo. Now the red rim of the sun pushes itself over the London cloud-bank. It shines on a good many folk, but on none, I dare bet, who are on a stranger errand than you and I. How small we feel with our petty ambitions and strivings in the presence of the great elemental forces of nature! Are you well up in your Jean Paul?”\n\n“Fairly so. I worked back to him through Carlyle.”\n\n“That was like following the brook to the parent lake. He makes one curious but profound remark. It is that the chief proof of man’s real greatness lies in his perception of his own smallness. It argues, you see, a power of comparison and of appreciation which is in itself a proof of nobility. There is much food for thought in Richter. You have not a pistol, have you?”\n\n“I have my stick.”\n\n“It is just possible that we may need something of the sort if we get to their lair. Jonathan I shall leave to you, but if the other turns nasty I shall shoot him dead.” He took out his revolver as he spoke, and, having loaded two of the chambers, he put it back into the right-hand pocket of his jacket.\n\nWe had during this time been following the guidance of Toby down the half-rural villa-lined roads which lead to the metropolis.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>JONATHAN SMALL<|>PERSON<|>Jonathan Small is a character who seeks revenge and treasure, known for having a wooden leg and a history of crime related to Bartholomew Sholto.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BARTHOLOMEW SHOLTO<|>PERSON<|>Bartholomew Sholto is a major who possesses knowledge of a hidden treasure and is targeted by Jonathan Small.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THADDEUS SHOLTO<|>PERSON<|>Thaddeus Sholto is the son of Bartholomew Sholto who witnesses Jonathan Small at the window.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LAL RAO<|>PERSON<|>Lal Rao is a butler associated with Bartholomew Sholto, described as having a questionable character.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANDAMANS<|>GEO<|>The Andamans are a group of islands where Jonathan Small served time, contributing to his sunburned appearance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LONDON<|>GEO<|>London is the city where the events unfold, particularly where Jonathan Small plans to confront Bartholomew Sholto.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TREASURE<|>EVENT<|>The treasure is a hidden asset that Jonathan Small is seeking, which is known only to Bartholomew Sholto and a faithful servant.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JONATHAN SMALL<|>BARTHOLOMEW SHOLTO<|>Jonathan Small seeks revenge on Bartholomew Sholto for wrongs done to him and is motivated by the desire to reclaim his treasure<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THADDEUS SHOLTO<|>BARTHOLOMEW SHOLTO<|>Thaddeus Sholto is the son of Bartholomew Sholto and is involved in the events surrounding Jonathan Small<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LAL RAO<|>BARTHOLOMEW SHOLTO<|>Lal Rao is the butler for Bartholomew Sholto, indicating a direct relationship in the household<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JONATHAN SMALL<|>ANDAMANS<|>Jonathan Small's time in the Andamans has affected his physical appearance and character, contributing to his motivations<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JONATHAN SMALL<|>LONDON<|>Jonathan Small returns to London to confront Bartholomew Sholto and seek his revenge<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BARTHOLOMEW SHOLTO<|>TREASURE<|>Bartholomew Sholto possesses knowledge of the treasure that Jonathan Small is seeking<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
