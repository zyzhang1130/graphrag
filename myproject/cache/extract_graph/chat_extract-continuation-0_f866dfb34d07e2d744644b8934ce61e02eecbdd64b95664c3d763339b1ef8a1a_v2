He is going to bring you up to my rooms, and I shall ask you for a true account of the matter. You must make a clean breast of it, for if you do I hope that I may be of use to you. I think I can prove that the poison acts so quickly that the man was dead before ever you reached the room.”\n\n“That he was, sir. I never got such a turn in my life as when I saw him grinning at me with his head on his shoulder as I climbed through the window. It fairly shook me, sir. I’d have half killed Tonga for it if he had not scrambled off. That was how he came to leave his club, and some of his darts too, as he tells me, which I dare say helped to put you on our track; though how you kept on it is more than I can tell. I don’t feel no malice against you for it. But it does seem a queer thing,” he added, with a bitter smile, “that I who have a fair claim to nigh upon half a million of money should spend the first half of my life building a breakwater in the Andamans, and am like to spend the other half digging drains at Dartmoor. It was an evil day for me when first I clapped eyes upon the merchant Achmet and had to do with the Agra treasure, which never brought anything but a curse yet upon the man who owned it. To him it brought murder, to Major Sholto it brought fear and guilt, to me it has meant slavery for life.”\n\nAt this moment Athelney Jones thrust his broad face and heavy shoulders into the tiny cabin. “Quite a family party,” he remarked. “I think I shall have a pull at that flask, Holmes. Well, I think we may all congratulate each other. Pity we didn’t take the other alive; but there was no choice. I say, Holmes, you must confess that you cut it rather fine. It was all we could do to overhaul her.”\n\n“All is well that ends well,” said Holmes. “But I certainly did not know that the Aurora was such a clipper.”\n\n“Smith says she is one of the fastest launches on the river, and that if he had had another man to help him with the engines we should never have caught her. He swears he knew nothing of this Norwood business.”\n\n“Neither he did,” cried our prisoner,—“not a word. I chose his launch because I heard that she was a flier. We told him nothing, but we paid him well, and he was to get something handsome if we reached our vessel, the Esmeralda, at Gravesend, outward bound for the Brazils.”\n\n“Well, if he has done no wrong we shall see that no wrong comes to him. If we are pretty quick in catching our men, we are not so quick in condemning them.” It was amusing to notice how the consequential Jones was already beginning to give himself airs on the strength of the capture. From the slight smile which played over Sherlock Holmes’s face, I could see that the speech had not been lost upon him.\n\n“We will be at Vauxhall Bridge presently,” said Jones, “and shall land you, Dr. Watson, with the treasure-box. I need hardly tell you that I am taking a very grave responsibility upon myself in doing this. It is most irregular; but of course an agreement is an agreement. I must, however, as a matter of duty, send an inspector with you, since you have so valuable a charge. You will drive, no doubt?”\n\n“Yes, I shall drive.”\n\n“It is a pity there is no key, that we may make an inventory first. You will have to break it open. Where is the key, my man?”\n\n“At the bottom of the river,” said Small, shortly.\n\n“Hum! There was no use your giving this unnecessary trouble. We have had work enough already through you. However, doctor, I need not warn you to be careful. Bring the box back with you to the Baker Street rooms. You will find us there, on our way to the station.”\n\nThey landed me at Vauxhall, with my heavy iron box, and with a bluff, genial inspector as my companion. A quarter of an hour’s drive brought us to Mrs. Cecil Forrester’s. The servant seemed surprised at so late a visitor. Mrs. Cecil Forrester was out for the evening, she explained, and likely to be very late. Miss Morstan, however, was in the drawing-room: so to the drawing-room I went, box in hand, leaving the obliging inspector in the cab.\n\nShe was seated by the open window, dressed in some sort of white diaphanous material, with a little touch of scarlet at the neck and waist. The soft light of a shaded lamp fell upon her as she leaned back in the basket chair, playing over her sweet, grave face, and tinting with a dull, metallic sparkle the rich coils of her luxuriant hair. One white arm and hand drooped over the side of the chair, and her whole pose and figure spoke of an absorbing melancholy. At the sound of my foot-fall she sprang to her feet, however, and a bright flush of surprise and of pleasure coloured her pale cheeks.\n\n“I heard a cab drive up,” she said. “I thought that Mrs. Forrester had come back very early, but I never dreamed that it might be you. What news have you brought me?”\n\n“I have brought something better than news,” said I, putting down the box upon the table and speaking jovially and boisterously, though my heart\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SCOTLAND YARD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Scotland Yard is the headquarters of the Metropolitan Police Service in London, known for its investigative work and law enforcement activities.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ATHELNEY JONES<|>PERSON<|>Athelney Jones is a detective associated with Scotland Yard, known for his broad face and heavy shoulders, and for leading investigations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHOLTO<|>PERSON<|>Major Sholto is a character involved in a narrative concerning treasure and its associated troubles, including fear and guilt.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AURORA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Aurora is described as a fast launch involved in a pursuit, noted for its speed on the river.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ESMERALDA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Esmeralda is a vessel mentioned as being outward bound for the Brazils, involved in the narrative of treasure and pursuit.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VAUXHALL BRIDGE<|>GEO<|>Vauxhall Bridge is a location in London where the characters land after their pursuit.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MRS.
