It is described as a hidden asset that Jonathan Small is actively seeking, known only to Bartholomew Sholto and a loyal servant. This treasure is a substantial cache of jewels, valued at half a million sterling, which Bartholomew discovered and is central to the case that Sherlock Holmes is investigating.\n\nThe treasure is intricately linked to several characters and events, including Mordecai Smith, who provides crucial information related to it, and the discussions between Captain Morstan and Thaddeus Sholto regarding its hidden nature. Additionally, the treasure is noted to have been robbed from Bartholomew Sholto, further complicating its narrative significance.\n\nMoreover, the treasure encompasses a collection of gems that Achmet was tasked with protecting, which became a focal point of conflict among the characters. It is also referred to as the Indian treasure, which is pivotal to the mystery surrounding Captain Morstan and the unfolding events. Ultimately, the treasure represents the wealth that Abdullah Khan and his comrades are attempting to acquire through their schemes, as well as the jewels that Jonathan Small and his associates sought and eventually retrieved.
